      <h2>The Foundation of Everything</h2>
      <p>Good health is the foundation of a good life. Without a strong body, a clear mind, and a peaceful spirit, even the best dreams remain out of reach.</p>

      <p>True health is about more than surviving — it's about thriving. It's about feeling energized, capable, and confident to build the life you dream of.</p>

      <h2>Small Habits Create Big Changes</h2>
      <p>Health isn't built in a day. It's built through small, daily habits: movement, sunlight, hydration, rest, mindfulness, and balanced nutrition.</p>
      
      <p>Training your body and mind to work together through consistent action is one of the most powerful gifts you can give yourself.</p>

      <h2>Supplements and Natural Support</h2>
      <p>While lifestyle is the core, certain supplements like magnesium, L-theanine, and adaptogens can help support focus, energy, and recovery. They are tools — not magic — to enhance a foundation built on real habits.</p>

      <p>The real magic is within you: your daily decisions, your vision for yourself, your resilience to keep showing up for life.</p>

      <h2>Energy Centers and the Body</h2>
      <p>Ancient traditions map the body through seven main chakras — energetic centers that mirror physical systems and emotional states. Paying attention to them can deepen the way you train, heal, and nourish yourself.</p>

      <div class="chakra-grid">
        <article class="chakra-card">
          <div class="chakra-icon chakra-root">1</div>
          <h3>Root · Stability</h3>
          <p>Base of the spine, legs, and feet. Train with grounding strength work, weighted carries, and slow breathing that signals safety.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="chakra-card">
          <div class="chakra-icon chakra-sacral">2</div>
          <h3>Sacral · Flow</h3>
          <p>Lower abdomen, hips, and pelvis. Explore mobility drills, hip openers, and creative movement that keeps your joints supple.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="chakra-card">
          <div class="chakra-icon chakra-solar">3</div>
          <h3>Solar Plexus · Power</h3>
          <p>Core, digestive fire, and personal drive. Focus on rotational strength, breath-led core work, and foods that fuel steady energy.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="chakra-card">
          <div class="chakra-icon chakra-heart">4</div>
          <h3>Heart · Expansion</h3>
          <p>Chest, lungs, and upper back. Blend postural training with cardio that uplifts mood and generous connection with others.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="chakra-card">
          <div class="chakra-icon chakra-throat">5</div>
          <h3>Throat · Expression</h3>
          <p>Neck, jaw, and thyroid health. Add breath pacing, vocal warmups, and mindful hydration to keep this channel open.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="chakra-card">
          <div class="chakra-icon chakra-third-eye">6</div>
          <h3>Third Eye · Insight</h3>
          <p>Eyes, brain, and nervous system. Practice single-point focus, gentle eye exercises, and screens-off time to reset.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="chakra-card">
          <div class="chakra-icon chakra-crown">7</div>
          <h3>Crown · Integration</h3>
          <p>Top of the head and full neural network. Prioritize deep rest, prayer, and stillness so the whole system can synchronize.</p>
        </article>
      </div>

      <p class="chakra-summary">Mixing strength, recovery, and mindful rituals through each center turns your training into a full-body dialogue — your muscles, organs, and energy working in harmony.</p>
