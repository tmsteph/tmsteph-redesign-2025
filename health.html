      <h2>The Foundation of Everything</h2>
      <p>Good health is the foundation of a good life. Without a strong body, a clear mind, and a peaceful spirit, even the best dreams remain out of reach.</p>

      <p>True health is about more than surviving — it's about thriving. It's about feeling energized, capable, and confident to build the life you dream of.</p>

      <h2>Small Habits Create Big Changes</h2>
      <p>Health isn't built in a day. It's built through small, daily habits: movement, sunlight, hydration, rest, mindfulness, and balanced nutrition.</p>
      
      <p>Training your body and mind to work together through consistent action is one of the most powerful gifts you can give yourself.</p>

      <h2>Supplements and Natural Support</h2>
      <p>While lifestyle is the core, certain supplements like magnesium, L-theanine, and adaptogens can help support focus, energy, and recovery. They are tools — not magic — to enhance a foundation built on real habits.</p>

      <p>The real magic is within you: your daily decisions, your vision for yourself, your resilience to keep showing up for life.</p>

      <h2>Energy Centers and the Body</h2>
      <p>Ancient traditions map the body through seven main chakras — energetic centers that mirror physical systems and emotional states. Paying attention to them can deepen the way you train, heal, and nourish yourself.</p>

      <ul class="chakra-list">
        <li><strong>Root (Muladhara)</strong> — base of the spine; supports your legs, feet, and sense of safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Sacral (Svadhisthana)</strong> — lower abdomen; relates to hips, reproductive organs, and creative flow.</li>
        <li><strong>Solar Plexus (Manipura)</strong> — upper abdomen; governs core strength, digestion, and personal power.</li>
        <li><strong>Heart (Anahata)</strong> — center of the chest; connects heart, lungs, and the ability to give and receive love.</li>
        <li><strong>Throat (Vishuddha)</strong> — throat and neck; supports thyroid health, voice, and clear communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Eye (Ajna)</strong> — between the brows; links brain, nervous system, and intuitive insight.</li>
        <li><strong>Crown (Sahasrara)</strong> — top of the head; represents the nervous system’s integration with higher consciousness.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Aligning movement, breath, and nutrition with these centers creates a holistic approach — strength training grounded in the root, mobility work freeing the hips, breath supporting the heart, mindful speech protecting the throat, and rest integrating the mind. Your body becomes a unified system working with your energy, not against it.</p>
