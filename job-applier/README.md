# Job Applier

This directory is the starting point for building a machine that applies to jobs for you.

## Vision
- Automate job discovery, filtering, and application submission.
- Centralize credentials and resume data for safe, consistent use.
- Track applications, outcomes, and feedback.

## Next Steps
- Define data sources (job boards, company pages, aggregators).
- Specify an application workflow (profile data, resume versions, cover letters).
- Build a tracking system (status, dates, notes).
