  <h1>Prayer as a Technology</h1>
  <p class="note">Structured requests appear to guide attention, which in turn can shift perception and behavior. This page collects patterns that make prayer feel repeatable and testable.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Working Definition</h2>
    <p>Prayer is a ritualized loop of intention, attention, and surrender. It creates a boundary in time where a person names a desired state, holds it steadily, and then releases control.</p>
    <p>Effective sessions seem to include three ingredients: clarity of request, embodied focus, and willingness to notice responses without forcing them.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Approaches to Try</h2>
    <div class="pill">Neural priming</div>
    <div class="pill">Somatic cues</div>
    <div class="pill">Collective timing</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Breath-linked petitions.</strong> Pair each inhale with a single phrase ("receive"), each exhale with another ("release"). The repetition stabilizes heart rate variability and anchors the request.</li>
      <li><strong>Spatial anchoring.</strong> Face the same direction, stand or kneel, and use consistent hand placement. Repeating the posture seems to prime the nervous system faster than words alone.</li>
      <li><strong>Time-boxed intercession.</strong> Choose a 10–15 minute window with others. Begin simultaneously. Compare notes afterward. This makes feedback observable instead of superstitious.</li>
      <li><strong>Closing and logging.</strong> End by writing what was asked for and what sensations or coincidences followed. Over weeks, the log shows whether changes cluster around sessions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Signals to Watch</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Emotional coherence: breath, heartbeat, and speech slowing together.</li>
      <li>Unexpected ease: actions that felt stuck moving with less resistance after prayer.</li>
      <li>Shared imagery: multiple people reporting similar symbols or words independently.</li>
      <li>Gentle course corrections: subtle urges to call, apologize, or pause that reduce friction later.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Open Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Is prayer primarily changing the petitioner, or does it interact with events beyond personal control?</li>
      <li>What role does group synchrony play versus solitary practice?</li>
      <li>Which environmental variables matter most: light, orientation, music, time of day?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
