  <h1>Language, Meaning, and Reality</h1>
  <p class="note">Language is a lens. Words reveal what we notice and hide what we ignore. Changing vocabulary often changes emotional tone, which then alters choices.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Framing Effects</h2>
    <blockquote>"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." — Wittgenstein</blockquote>
    <p>How we name events shapes their perceived significance. Calling a setback a "prototype" instead of a "failure" keeps attention on iteration rather than shame.</p>
    <p>Teams that maintain shared definitions (what does "done" mean?) experience fewer coordination slips and less rework.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precision journaling.</strong> Describe feelings with sensory detail instead of labels. Notice how new words expand possible responses.</li>
      <li><strong>Reframing drills.</strong> Rewrite a recurring complaint using neutral or curious language. Observe how physiology shifts.</li>
      <li><strong>Shared glossaries.</strong> In groups, publish definitions of key terms. Update them when disagreements appear.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Language as Action</h2>
    <p>Declarations ("I will"), requests ("Will you?"), and promises are not just descriptions—they are performative acts that reshape social reality. Conscious use of these speech acts can accelerate trust or repair.</p>
    <p>Silence is also communicative. Intentional pauses during conflict can de-escalate faster than adding more words.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Areas to Explore</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do multilingual people experience broader emotional ranges when switching languages?</li>
      <li>How much of "manifestation" is simply consistent self-suggestion via language?</li>
      <li>Can we design micro-scripts that reliably shift teams from panic to problem-solving?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
