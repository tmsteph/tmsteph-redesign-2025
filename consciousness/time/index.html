  <h1>Time, Memory, and Causality</h1>
  <p class="note">Memory is not a perfect recording. It is an active interface that seems to update based on present needs and narratives. If attention influences how memory consolidates, it could also shape which futures we notice.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Perception of Time</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Novelty stretches time. First-time experiences generate dense memory packets, making minutes feel longer.</li>
      <li>Monotony compresses time. Repetition without engagement removes markers, so hours collapse.</li>
      <li>Focused flow suspends time. When feedback is immediate and stakes are clear, time tracking fades entirely.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Memory as a Writable Store</h2>
    <p>Recalled memories are reconstructed, not replayed. Each recall is a chance for edits: language, emotional tone, and body posture all feed into the rewrite.</p>
    <p>Practices that pair recollection with calm breath (like EMDR or guided re-scripting) show how present states can change the emotional weight of past events.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Personal Experiments</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Pre-sleep intent</h3>
        <p>Set a specific question before sleep, write it down, and review upon waking. Track if dreams or morning insights relate. After two weeks, patterns emerge.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Memory tagging</h3>
        <p>When a significant event occurs, choose a physical anchor (touching wrist, looking up). Repeat that anchor when recalling the event to see if intensity shifts.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Future rehearsal</h3>
        <p>Visualize a near-term scenario (meeting, conversation) with sensory detail. Compare actual outcomes to rehearsals to test whether attention changed behavior.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Questions in Progress</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do synchronized visualizations among groups correlate with different outcomes than individual rehearsal?</li>
      <li>How do circadian rhythms interact with memory reconsolidation and intention setting?</li>
      <li>Can changing language about the past measurably alter physiological stress markers?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
