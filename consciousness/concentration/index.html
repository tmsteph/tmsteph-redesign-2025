  <h1>Concentration & Attention</h1>
  <p class="note">Attention behaves like a finite resource with recovery curves. Training it deliberately seems to alter perception and emotional regulation faster than changing beliefs alone.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Training Cycles</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Warm Start (5–10 min)</h3>
        <p>Slow breathing through the nose, eyes resting on a fixed point. Count 1–10 on the exhale, repeat. This stabilizes before deeper work.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Deep Focus (25 min)</h3>
        <p>Single-task with no audio. Keep a notepad for intrusive thoughts; park them and return. Aim for two uninterrupted blocks per day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Recovery (5–15 min)</h3>
        <p>Walk without phone. Let eyes scan the horizon; this lateral movement seems to reset arousal and prevent burnout.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Micro-Drills</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>One object.</strong> Pick a stone or glass of water. Describe it silently for two minutes. Notice when attention drifts and gently return.</li>
      <li><strong>Auditory channel.</strong> Sit in silence and track only faraway sounds. When thoughts intrude, tag them as "planning" or "memory" and return to listening.</li>
      <li><strong>Text sprint.</strong> Read one paragraph aloud, then repeat from memory. This quickly reveals capacity and fatigue.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Restoration & Limits</h2>
    <p>Chronic distraction often signals exhaustion, not moral failure. Nutrition, sleep, and movement are prerequisites. Caffeine feels like focus but can mask depletion; cycles of stimulation require cycles of quiet.</p>
    <p>Social media audits—deleting apps for 72 hours—often restore baseline concentration more than any drill.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Measures Worth Tracking</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Time to settle: minutes from starting a session to feeling engaged.</li>
      <li>Session count: number of 25-minute blocks achieved per day.</li>
      <li>Interruption recovery: how long it takes to regain the previous state after a ping or knock.</li>
      <li>Emotional stability: mood variance before vs. after focus training weeks.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
