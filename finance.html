      <h2>Wealth Is Simpler Than We Think</h2>
      <p>Humans need only a few things to survive: air, water, food, and shelter. Everything else is built on top of that foundation. Yet in our modern world, these basics have become artificially scarce, complicated by systems of control and dependency.</p>
      
      <p>Building wealth — real wealth — begins by understanding this simplicity, and shifting from consumer thinking to producer thinking.</p>

      <h2>From Employee to Entrepreneur</h2>
      <p>Most people trade time for a paycheck, giving away their creativity and energy to employers in exchange for security. But true freedom comes from learning to treat yourself like a business — investing in your skills, building assets, solving problems for others, and growing independent streams of income.</p>
      
      <p>Success comes when you work not for immediate rewards, but for future returns.</p>

      <h2>Freedom Through Creation</h2>
      <p>When you become a producer — of ideas, solutions, services, or experiences — you step into your true creative power. You start shaping your own life instead of renting it out.</p>

      <p>My mission is to create systems, platforms, and communities that make it easier for anyone to take this journey — to build freedom by building value.</p>
